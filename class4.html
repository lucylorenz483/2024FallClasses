        <h2>Life in a Built Environment</h2>
        <p> In the course I will look at life as we know it today, and we will explore the monumental challenges we are now facing with resource limits, pollution, and climate change. We will also explore possible solutions to the challenging problems of equity and inclusion that have been part of the built environment from the beginning.</p>
